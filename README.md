# Practice

This repository aggregates my public GitHub projects under `projects/`. Each folder mirrors the original repository so everything is in one place.

Included projects:

- `Complete-SQL-Database-Bootcamp-Zero-to-Mastery`
- `GITModule3lab`
- `it-cert-automation-practice`
- `rearrange`
- `validations`

These copies were pulled on 2025-10-02. Update the folders whenever the upstream repos change.
